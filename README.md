# Concrete

Concrete Shopify Theme Framework - A lightweight framework for building Shopify themes

Concrete has recently been rebuilt using [slate](https://shopify.github.io/slate/). The latest release is still being tested and may not have all of the same features as the previous release. We are working towards a full stable release and documentation. In the meantime, please feel very welcome to raise issues.
